# Proposed Reading / Presentations
## 2020 Winter
  * [Learning Symbolic Physics with Graph Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05862)
Closely related to [Interaction Networks for Learning about Objects, Relations and Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00222). There is a NeurISP talk online (Gorka please add link?)

  * [Deep Learning for Symbolic Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01412v1) Guillaume Lample, François Charton
Symbolid integration and solving ODEs with seq2seq models (so called transformers?)

  * [Quantum Algorithms for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://scirate.com/arxiv/1911.01117) , Iordanis Kerenidis, Jonas Landman, Anupam Prakash
Quantum algorithm to "mimic" (?) convolutional NN, i.e. including non-linearity.

  * [Cost-Function-Dependent Barren Plateaus in Shallow Quantum Neural Networks](https://scirate.com/arxiv/2001.00550)     M. Cerezo, Akira Sone, Tyler Volkoff, Lukasz Cincio, Patrick J. Coles
Extension to the previous [Barren plateau result](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11173). Essentially all QNN (i.e. including shallow ones) suffer from Barren plteaus (BP) when using non-local/global cost functions. Details for deep (BP), intermediate and shallow (trainable) circuits with local cost functions.

 * [Data re-uploading for a universal quantum classifier](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-02-06-226/)
 Adrián Pérez-Salinas Alba Cervera-Lierta Elies Gil-Fuster, and José I. Latorre
