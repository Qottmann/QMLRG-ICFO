# Proposed Reading / Presentations
## 2020 Winter
  * [Learning Symbolic Physics with Graph Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05862)
Closely related to [Interaction Networks for Learning about Objects, Relations and Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00222). See also [NeurIPS talk](https://slideslive.com/38922576/learning-symbolic-physics-with-graph-networks)

  * [Quantum Algorithms for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://scirate.com/arxiv/1911.01117) , Iordanis Kerenidis, Jonas Landman, Anupam Prakash
Quantum algorithm to "mimic" (?) convolutional NN, i.e. including non-linearity.

  * [Cost-Function-Dependent Barren Plateaus in Shallow Quantum Neural Networks](https://scirate.com/arxiv/2001.00550)     M. Cerezo, Akira Sone, Tyler Volkoff, Lukasz Cincio, Patrick J. Coles
Extension to the previous [Barren plateau result](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11173). Essentially all QNN (i.e. including shallow ones) suffer from Barren plteaus (BP) when using non-local/global cost functions. Details for deep (BP), intermediate and shallow (trainable) circuits with local cost functions.

 * [Recurrent Neural Network Wavefunctions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02973.pdf)     Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Martin Ganahl, Lauren E. Hayward, Roger G. Melko, Juan Carrasquilla
 * [Variational Quantum Fidelity Estimation](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-03-26-248/) Marco Cerezo, Alexander Poremba, Lukasz Cincio, and Patrick J. Coles, with example of detecting phase transitions
